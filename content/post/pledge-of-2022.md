The first working day of 2022 is upon us tomorrow. Not for me. I am on maternity leave and for me it’s the first day of dropping off the littlest one for their first day of settling into nursery. I am hit with a few more emotions than I was with the ‘biggest little one’ because this really is the last maternity leave I plan to take.

Maternity leave was first introduced as part of the Employment Protection Act 1975 but few were eligible due to the long qualifying periods of employment required to qualify. Forty-seven years later, things have moved on and I am super lucky to have a fantastic employer and ever so grateful for an understanding line manager who has really supported me. It has made me think of all those pioneers who have constantly made a nuisance of themselves to fight for equality for working mothers. I thank them eternally.

I did some proper soul searching last year (I recommend Madeira for this) and I feel now is the time for me to push on with my program management career, get back to mentoring, champion getting the best out of each other and be a role model to others.

I feel this first entry has turned more into a pledge but hopefully the posts to come (weekly) will concentrate on thought leadership, tech program management and any other amusing work observations all through the eyes of a working mother determined to help pave the way for others.
